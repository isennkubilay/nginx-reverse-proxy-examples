## Nginx Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy in Nginx is a configuration where Nginx acts as a server in front of your actual application server. It accepts client requests, forwards them to the application server, and returns the server's response back to the client. This can provide benefits such as load balancing, security, or caching.

Here's a basic example of an Nginx reverse proxy configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://your_application_server;
    }
}
```

In this example, Nginx listens on port 80 for requests to example.com. When it receives a request, it forwards the request to http://your_application_server. The response from the application server is then sent back to the client.

This is a very basic example. Nginx's reverse proxy capabilities are very flexible and can be configured for more complex scenarios. I will add more examples this repo
